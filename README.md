# Quality of Life Mods

---

## Advanced Box System


Expands the original PC Box interface with faster navigation, direct swapping, and improved Box management.

### WITHDRAW

While browsing stored Pokémon:

- press **Left / Right** to switch instantly between **BOX 1 and BOX 14**;
- Box switching remains available even when the current Box is empty;
- you can continue moving between Boxes without returning to the main PC menu.

### DEPOSIT

While viewing the party:

- remain directly in the party list;
- press **Left / Right** to change the destination Box in real time;
- if the selected Box is full, you can immediately move to the next Box without leaving the menu.

### SWAP POKéMON

Adds a dedicated **SWAP POKéMON** option.

To swap Pokémon:

1. select a Pokémon stored in a Box;
2. select a Pokémon in the party;
3. the two Pokémon are exchanged directly.

The swap system also works when:

- the party already contains **6 Pokémon**;
- the party contains only **1 Pokémon**.

Because the total number of party members does not change, the normal party-size restrictions do not prevent the swap.

### Quick SWAP

A direct **SWAP** action is also available inside both:

- **WITHDRAW**
- **DEPOSIT**

This allows Pokémon to be exchanged without returning to the main PC menu.

### RELEASE

The **RELEASE** menu also supports **Left / Right** Box switching, allowing you to move between Boxes without leaving the release screen.

---

## Area DexNav

Press **SELECT** while exploring the overworld to start an encounter with an uncaught Pokémon from the current area's real encounter table.

---

## DV/EV Editor

Adds a **DV/EV** option to each party Pokémon's submenu, allowing its hidden stat values to be edited outside of battle.

> In Generation III, the values traditionally called DVs in earlier generations correspond to **IVs**.

### DV / IV Page

Allows you to edit all six individual values:

- HP;
- Attack;
- Defense;
- Speed;
- Special Attack;
- Special Defense.

Each IV can be adjusted from `0` to `31`.

### EV Page

Allows the six EV values to be edited individually:

- HP;
- Attack;
- Defense;
- Speed;
- Special Attack;
- Special Defense.

The editor makes it possible to review the Pokémon's training values directly from the party menu and see the resulting stat changes without needing an external tool.

---

## EXP Share Modes

Adds three selectable Experience Point distribution modes.

| Mode | Behavior |
|---|---|
| **Off** | Only conscious Pokémon that participated in battle receive experience. |
| **Classic Even Split** | Default mode. The full experience pool is divided evenly among all conscious Pokémon in the party. |
| **Modern Progressive** | Participants split the normal 100% experience pool, while conscious Pokémon that did not battle split a second 50% pool. The total is approximately `1.5×`. |

---

<a id="free-master-ball"></a>
## Free Master Ball + Rare Candy + Evolution Items + Max Repel

Combines the previous free-item shop mods into a single Generation III quality-of-life mod.

### Free Mart Items

The following items are made available through standard Poké Marts for **¥0**:

- **MASTER BALL**;
- **RARE CANDY**;
- **MAX REPEL**.

### Evolution Items

The mod also adds access to the supported evolution items through a dedicated **EVOLUTION** shop section.

All supported evolution items are sold for **¥0**, allowing trade- and item-based evolution requirements to be handled without money grinding.

The evolution catalog includes the supported stones and held evolution items used by the game, such as:

- Fire Stone;
- Water Stone;
- Thunder Stone;
- Leaf Stone;
- Moon Stone;
- Sun Stone;
- King's Rock;
- Metal Coat;
- Dragon Scale;
- Up-Grade.

This combines the functionality previously documented as **Free Master Ball + Rare Candy**, **Free Max Repel**, and **Free Evolution Items**.

---

## HM Anywhere

Allows supported Generation III field moves to be used without teaching them to a Pokémon.

You only need to have the corresponding HM in your Bag. Badge requirements for field moves are still respected where applicable.

### Field Move Support

The mod is designed around FireRed's overworld HM actions, including supported uses such as:

- **CUT** — use Cut on valid trees or bushes;
- **SURF** — enter water from a valid shoreline;
- **STRENGTH** — activate Strength for movable boulders;
- **FLASH** — activate Flash where the field effect is supported;
- **FLY** — open the Fly destination flow;
- **ROCK SMASH** — break valid rocks;
- **WATERFALL** — use Waterfall where supported.

The purpose is to preserve normal progression requirements while removing the need to permanently occupy a Pokémon move slot with a field move.

---

## Item Shortcut

Press the default shortcut button in the overworld to open a menu containing five item slots.

### Default Controls

| Action | Keyboard | Controller |
|---|---|---|
| Open Shortcut Menu | `I` | `Y` |
| Use FAST Item | `K` | `X` |

### Slot Actions

Each assigned slot provides the following actions:

- **USE** — immediately uses the assigned item;
- **SET FAST** — marks the item for quick use;
- **CLEAR** — removes the item from the slot.

### Assigning an Item

Items are assigned directly from the Bag:

```text
BAG → Select Item → ASSIGN SHORTCUT → Choose Slot 1–5
```

One of the five slots can be designated as the **FAST** slot.

Press the assigned **FAST Item** button in the overworld to use that item immediately.

### Control Remapping

Both shortcut buttons can be remapped directly from the **Item Shortcut** menu.

Open the menu using:

- **Keyboard:** `I`
- **Controller:** `Y`

Then select **OPTIONS** to change the controls.

---

## Modern Bag


Transforms the Bag into a modern inventory divided into multiple pockets, navigated with **Left** and **Right**.

It also removes the original 20-item-type capacity limit.

### Available Pockets

| Pocket | Contents |
|---|---|
| **FAVORITES** | Any items marked as favorites. Accessible by pressing **Left** from the Medicine pocket. |
| **MEDICINE** | Potions, status-healing items, Revives, Ether, Elixir, vitamins, PP Ups, and Rare Candies. |
| **BALLS** | Poké Balls, Great Balls, Ultra Balls, Master Balls, and Balls added by other mods. |

### Opening Pocket

A new **Opening Pocket** option lets you choose which Bag pocket is displayed when the Bag is opened.

Available choices:

- **Favorites**
- **Medicine**
- **Balls**
- **TM/HM**
- **Battle**
- **Key Items**
- **Other**
- **Last Used**

**Medicine** remains the default setting for backwards compatibility.

When **Last Used** is selected, the Bag remembers the pocket you were viewing and automatically reopens on that same pocket the next time.

### Hold Scroll Speed

A new **Hold Scroll Speed** option controls how quickly the item list scrolls while a direction is held.

Available settings:

- **Off**
- **Normal**
- **Fast**
- **Very Fast**

**Fast** is the new default setting.

### Favorites

A new **FAVORITES** pocket has been added.

It can be opened by pressing **Left** from the **MEDICINE** pocket.

Any item can be added to Favorites, and favorite items can be used normally directly from this section.

### Item Options

Press **SELECT** on an item to open the **ITEM OPTIONS** menu:

- **ADD FAVORITE** / **REMOVE FAVORITE**
- **PIN TO TOP** / **UNPIN ITEM**
- **MOVE ITEM**
- **CANCEL**

### Pinned Items

Pinned items:

- always remain at the top of their category;
- are not moved by alphabetical sorting;
- preserve the order in which they were pinned;
- remain pinned after closing and reopening the game.

### Indicators

The following indicators may appear next to an item's quantity:

| Indicator | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `F` | Favorite |
| `P` | Pinned to the top |
| `PF` | Favorite and pinned |

Favorite and pinned settings remain saved even when an item's quantity reaches zero.

When the item is obtained again, it automatically returns with the same settings.

### Automatic Sorting

Items are sorted automatically whenever the Bag is opened.

The sorting order is based on:

1. pocket;
2. pinned-item order;
3. item name.

TMs and HMs are sorted numerically, with HMs listed before TMs.

The automatic sorting is refreshed whenever you obtain a new type of item.

Manual reordering remains available through **SELECT → ITEM OPTIONS → MOVE ITEM** during the current play session.

### Quick Search

Press **START** while inside any standard Bag pocket to open the general search screen.

#### Controls

- **D-pad** — move across the on-screen keyboard;
- **A** — enter a character;
- **B** — delete a character or exit;
- **SELECT** — clear the current search;
- **START** or **GO** — display the search results.

The search checks every Bag pocket.

Selecting a result automatically returns you to the correct pocket with the matching item highlighted.

The search also correctly recognizes item names containing special characters, such as **POKé BALL**.

### TM/HM Search, Filters, and Sorting

While inside the **TM HM** pocket, press **START** to open a dedicated panel.

The panel provides the following options:

- **NAME** — search by move name, not only by TM or HM number;
- **TYPE** — filter by move type, including Fire, Water, Grass, Electric, Psychic, and others;
- **CLASS** — filter moves by category:
  - **PHYSICAL**
  - **SPECIAL**
  - **STATUS**
- **SORT** — choose one of the following sorting methods:
  - **Machine Number**
  - **Move Name**
  - **Power High to Low**
  - **Power Low to High**

All filters can be combined.

### TM/HM Move Information

With a TM or HM highlighted, press:

- **Controller:** `Y`
- **Keyboard:** `I`

The information screen displays:

- TM or HM number;
- move name;
- type;
- Physical, Special, or Status class;
- power;
- accuracy;
- PP;
- move effect.

---

## Move Learn Stats


When a Pokémon already knows four moves and must forget one to learn a new move, the lower panel displays two comparison columns.

### SELECTED

Shows the currently highlighted move that would be forgotten:

- move name;
- **POWER**;
- maximum **PP**.

### LEARNING

Shows the new move the Pokémon is about to learn:

- move name;

---

### Main Page

Displays:

Press `A` on a move's technical page to choose a replacement from the Pokémon's move memory.

The initial move memory is rebuilt using:

- currently known moves;
- starting moves from the evolutionary line;
- level-up moves learned up to the Pokémon's current level.

---

## Nickname Changer

Adds a new renaming option directly to the standard **POKéMON** menu.

When selecting a Pokémon, the submenu now includes:

```text
STATS → RENAME → SWITCH
```

### Features

- Change a Pokémon's nickname directly from the party menu.
- Nicknames can contain up to **10 characters**.

---

## Pokédex Plus

Pokédex Plus replaces the original Pokédex with a more complete and practical version.

For each Pokémon, it allows you to view general information, base stats, habitats, encounter rates, evolutions, and moves learned by leveling up.

### Features

- Caught Pokémon indicator.
- Automatic scanning of the current party and every PC Box.
- **STATS** tab showing type, base stats, and total base stat value.

## PokéCenter Max Happiness

Automatically maximizes the happiness of every Pokémon in the party whenever the team is healed normally at a Pokémon Center.

### How It Works

1. Heal your party normally at a Pokémon Center.
2. Immediately after the healing process is completed, every Pokémon currently in the party is set to **255 happiness**.

---

## Trade Evolution Fix

Removes the need to trade Pokémon in order to complete supported trade evolutions.

Affected trade-only evolutions are replaced with direct in-game evolution requirements so they can be completed in a single-player FireRed save without using another game or console.

Where the mod uses level-based replacements, the Pokémon evolves normally once the configured level requirement is reached.

---

## Repel Reuse

When a Repel's effect expires, a choice is displayed automatically:

- **YES** — immediately consumes and activates another Repel;
- **NO** — continues without using another Repel.

The prompt is not displayed when no Repels remain in the Bag.

### Repel Selection Priority

The mod first attempts to use the same type of Repel that just expired. If none remain, it automatically selects one in this order:

1. **MAX REPEL**
2. **SUPER REPEL**
3. **REPEL**

---

## Reusable Machines

Improves how TMs and HMs work:

- TMs are no longer consumed when teaching a move;
- HM moves can be forgotten;
- the move assigned to each TM or HM is displayed directly in the Bag.

---

## Stable Menu Navigation - Gen 3

Keeps menu navigation speed stable and independent from the game's speed setting.

When the game speed is increased, cursor movement and directional navigation inside menus remain consistent, making menu controls easier and more precise at higher game speeds.

---

## Summon

Adds a **SUMMON** option to the Start menu.

It allows you to enter a Pokédex number and immediately begin a normal wild encounter with the corresponding Pokémon.

### Usage

1. Select **SUMMON**.
2. Enter the Pokédex number.
3. Check the Pokémon name displayed in the window.
4. Select **OK**.
5. Begin the wild encounter.

---

## Universal Free TM Shop


Speaking to the clerk in any Poké Mart opens a new menu with the following options:

- **NORMAL SHOP** — opens the Mart's original item catalog;
- **TM SHOP** — opens a catalog containing every TM from TM01 to TM50;
- **LEAVE** — closes the shop menu.

### TM Shop Features

- TMs are sorted numerically.
- Each entry also displays the move contained in the TM.
- Every TM is sold for `0`.

---

<a id="disable_help_lr"></a>
## disable_help_LR

Disables FireRed's built-in **L/R Help** shortcut.

This prevents the contextual Help screen from opening when the shoulder buttons are pressed, reducing accidental interruptions and leaving **L** and **R** available for modern menu navigation or other mod controls.

---
